<!-- Limits -->
<section class="content">
    <h2>What limits are there?</h2>
    <p>Files are kept for {{{ timeFileCanStayAlive }}} after being uploaded.</p>
    <p>Storage is only limited per file, and is specific for each user, but the default is 5 GiB.<br>
    This means, in theory you could upload 1000x 5 GiB files and fill the server, but please don't.</p>

    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <h2>How to get an invite</h2>
    <p>You can apply in the #apply channel on Discord, you will then have to wait for an admin to review your
        application.<br>
        If you haven't gotten a reply within 24 hours give katt a nudge.</p>

    <h2>What gets my access revoked?</h2>
    <p>If you're caught uploading malware, CP or any other retarded shit your account will be terminated.<br>
        Excessive amounts of Google bitching at me about your uploads will also get you banned.</p>

    <h2>I forgot my password</h2>
    <p>Send a DM to katt using the same account you applied with, and you'll get a reset key.</p>

    <h2>I've found a bug, missing feature etc!</h2>
    <p>Please submit a ticket at GitHub describing the best you can what's going on and what <b>should</b> be going on.
